Testing GitHub Functionality This is a file where I put some shortcut note for MACbook Air

I have really enjoyed my training at the Charleston Iron Yard and would highly recommend the full immersion of 
learning code by attending a Ruby On Rails or Front End Class at on of the Iron Yard Training centers.

Take a look at this web site and see what it is all about: http://theironyard.com/academy/rails-engineering/

Hope these shortcuts help, if you want to practice with GitHUb fork and merge any ideas or helps you have found.

Take Care,
Best wishes to you and - Happy Coding,
